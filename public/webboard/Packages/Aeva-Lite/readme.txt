[center][color=red][size=16pt][b]Auto-Embed Video & Audio (Aeva) v7.1.708[/b][/size][/color]
Developed by [b][url=http://www.simplemachines.org/community/index.php?action=profile;u=13794]Nao/Gilles[/url][/b]
[hr][url=http://aeva.noisen.com/][b]Official Website & Demo[/b][/url]
Make sure to try Aeva's successor mod,
[b][url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=977]Aeva Media[/url][/b].[/center][hr]

[color=blue][size=12pt][u][b]What does it do?[/b][/u][/size][/color]
Automatically embed video and audio clips by posting the clip's URL in your SMF forum posts from over [size=11pt][b]200[/b][/size] sites (hundreds if you count the supported networks), including YouTube, DailyMotion, MetaCafe, Google Video, MySpace, Facebook, Veoh...
No need for BBCode or messy embed HTML. And if a user posts the embed html code for a site, it'll be turned automatically into a nice little furry harmless link.

Just copy the URL from your address bar into a post (like [nobbc]http://youtube.com/watch?v=B8XC7idFyvE[/nobbc]), and Aeva will do the rest. It's the ultimate user-friendly way of posting clips. YouTube videos will automatically appear in HD and Widescreen if available and enabled.

[color=blue][size=12pt][u][b]License Agreement[/b][/u][/size][/color]
Do you like reading annoying legal mumbo-jumbo? Neither do I. So let's cut the crap and skip to the rules.
Aeva is completely free to use, even on commercial websites. By installing it, however, you agree to the following rules.
Otherwise, you're in breach of the licence and will be exposed to potential damage such as a lawsuit, complete and utter humiliation in public, and not finding your shoes when you're already late for work.

[list][li]You will not distribute a modified version of it,[/li]
[li]You will neither remove nor hide the backlink to the Aeva/Noisen site without written permission from the author,[/li]
[li]You must protect your own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second rule. (Thanks Isaac.)[/li]
[li]You will not install/use Aeva on a website that encourages and/or endorses violence, hate and/or any kind of bigotry. Be nice to each other![/li]
[/list]

[color=blue][size=12pt][u][b]Compatibility[/b][/u][/size][/color]
ANY version of SMF 1.1.x and SMF 2.0 will do.
[b]All previous versions of this mod MUST be uninstalled BEFORE installing this version. Also, make sure to backup your database and files first.[/b]
If a version of Aeva >= 5.2 is already installed, you don't need to uninstall and reinstall, you can simply overwrite the Aeva source and language files with newer versions, no further changes being made to the SMF core files.

[color=blue][size=12pt][u][b]Features[/b][/u][/size][/color]
[list]
[li]Works for all languages. Will fall back to the English version if your own language is missing.[/li]
[li]Contains the following translations: [b]English[/b] (American and British) and [b]French[/b]. You can find more languages at [url=http://aeva.noisen.com/trans/][b]Aeva translations[/b][/url]. You can even submit your own over there.[/li]
[li]Two new areas in the Admin panel enable you to choose which sites to embed, as well as settings aplenty.
- Enable/disable mod, allow embed code fix, use Javascript to embed videos (which is recommended), inline upgrade of Flash version, debug mode for admins, allow for video embedding into quotes or in the middle of sentences...
- Lookups - grab the actual video url/filename when posting a new link. Enables support for dozens of sites.
- Include link with URL/title below the video (for sites without a clickable link/button in the video)
- Embed local files (except for attachments) (MP3, MP4, FLV, DivX, Avi, SWF, Real Media, Windows Media, Quicktime)[/li]
[li]The site list is optimized to use only the features you enabled, and it's automatically updated when a new version is available. You only need to visit the admin area if you want to enable newly added sites. You can also force an immediate check for sitelist updates (instead of daily checks) by going to a forum page where Aeva is in use (eg a video is visible), and adding ";checkaeva" to the URL. This can be restricted to admins via the admin area.[/li]
[li]Create your own custom site lists or per-site settings, such as custom video dimensions. More details in the Subs-Aeva-Custom-Example.php file.
[/li][li]Users can select on-the-fly their preferred embed size, normal or maximum (saved in a cookie)[/li]
[li]No manual edits required for custom themes. No conflicts with mods that provide support for a single website with custom BBCode and a video ID. But you'll never want to use them again. Just use the conversion script included in the package to convert old BBCode.[/li]
[li]Completely safe and secure: Aeva controls everything your users post. It even disables remote script access.[/li]
[li]If you're not sure, be happy -- embedding of external videos will NOT consume your bandwidth[/li]
[/list]

[color=blue][size=12pt][u][b]Support[/b][/u][/size][/color]
[list]
[li]If a YouTube video doesn't automatically switch to Widescreen when available, make sure lookups are enabled in the admin area. If your server doesn't support them, you can still manually add #ws-hd at the end of an URL for Widescreen HD.[/li]
[li]Aeva only converts active links, so make sure the setting "Automatically link posted URLs" is enabled (Admin > Posts & Topics > Bulletin Board Code)[/li]
[li]A recent version of [url=http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=tn_15507][b]Adobe Flash Player[/b][/url] is required (at least 9.0).[/li]
[li]If you get a "We're sorry, this video is no longer available" message on YouTube videos, this is not an Aeva bug. It can either be due to the video not being embeddable (make sure lookups are enabled to check for these when posting), or simply to its streaming server being under maintenance. Try to play it again later.[/li]
[li]If you're having Error 500-type crashes on your server, try to disable SMF's "compressed output" feature in your server settings, and ask Santa Claus for a better server next Christmas.[/li]
[/list]

[color=red][size=14pt]ModifyAevaSettings() errors.[/size][/color]

Please refer to this every time someone posts an error message mentioning that function.

"Undefined function" error -> this is a mod screwing up your install (it could possibly be any mod, but AjaxChat is the better known one.) It doesn't follow SMF guidelines for its install script. It's not Aeva's fault. Quick workaround: make sure to install Aeva before you install that mod. It's already cost me hours in explaining the same thing again and again, I will no longer be replying to this kind of request.

"Already defined" error -> this is a SMF limitation. It doesn't try to check whether you already installed a mod before. As a result, if you don't uninstall a mod before reinstalling it, everything will be copied twice. This is a problem on ALL PACKAGES and can only be fixed by educating yourself on how to install packages in current versions of SMF. Quick workaround: apart from being careful next time, there is none. You'll have to uninstall Aeva manually, file by file. It's not a big mod though, so it shouldn't take more than 10 minutes.

[b]Disabling Embedding In Posts[/b]
[list]
[li]Use [b][noembed][/noembed][/b] BBCode to prevent a link from being converted. Also, if the related setting is enabled, videos inserted in a sentence are not embedded (they're only shown when they're at the beginning of a line), so you can use that to your benefit.[/li]
[/list]

[b]Disabling Embedding In Specific Areas[/b]
[list]
[li]Embedding is automatically disabled in signatures, printer pages and SMF2's WYSIWYG editor. You may want to be able to disable it for other sections, such as a Shoutbox.[/li]
[li]Just find the position, in the relevant source file, where data is put through the "parse_bbc" function. Then on the line BEFORE it, add the code below. If there's a chance the string you're going to parse is empty, make sure to unset the following call ([i]unset($context['aeva_disable']);[/i]) after the parse_bbc() that follows it.[/li]
[/list]
[pre][size=9pt]
		$context['aeva_disable'] = 1;[/size][/pre]

[color=blue][size=12pt][u][b]Aeva's future[/b][/u][/size][/color]

The Aeva auto-embedder was integrated into Aeva Media back in February 2010. In effect, this adds a gallery system to your website, which you are free to enable
(or not) through the permission system. The sitelist won't be updated as often as it used to. More specifically, new sites will scarcely be added.
Please consider upgrading to Aeva Media. It's still free.
