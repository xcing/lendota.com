
-----------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to... The Aeva changelog. What else did you expect?
-----------------------------------------------------------

! Fixes + Additions - Removals * Changes @ Notes

Version 7.1.708                                  28th August 2010
-----------------------------------------------------------------
! Forcing cache to be disabled on posts, because this would break Javascript code.
+ Added support for HTML-type embedding, and Google Maps (which uses just that)
* Added support for YouTube's data API. It fixes those pesky permanently
  broken lookups after embedding a certain amount of videos.
! Hopefully fixed internal version numbers, avoiding some broken sitelists.
! More minor fixes from the Aeva Media 2.x codebase.

Version 7.0.707                                   12th March 2010
-----------------------------------------------------------------
! Fixed an incompatibility with SMF2 RC3 by removing some install
  code that was redundant for preventing embedding in signatures.

Version 7.0.706                                 2nd December 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Changed copyright notice to make it less intrusive
* Slightly rewrote sitelist update system to accomodate for Aeva Media
* Enable auto-embed module by default on first install... Let's be crazy!
! SMF 1.1.11 broke links enclosed in noembed tags... Bad boy!
! Links such as *.avi.html could get embedded... Bad me!

Version 7.0.705                                 9th November 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
@ Stay tuned for Aeva Media, the upcoming über-media mod!
! Don't proceed with the sitelist update if Aeva couldn't create the target file
* Improved compatibility with other mods editing the Subs-Editor.php file
- Removed support for adult websites, happily complying with SMF's new policy

! Yet another fix for YouTube's Widescreen feature...
! Updated patterns for The Onion, Sapo.pt and TinyPic

Version 7.0.703                                 28th October 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
+ Added (or fixed) support for local MP4 files

Version 7.0.702                                 22th October 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Added admin area layout compatibility for SMF2's Curve theme
! Aeva will no longer show its copyright notice on pages
  where no videos are actually shown

! Fixed widescreen support for YouTube (recent change in their code)

Version 7.0.701                                  7th October 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
+ Added installer compatibility with PostgreSQL and SQLite (hopefully)
+ Added installer support for SMF2 RC2, in case it was needed
! Installer should no longer reset your settings after an upgrade
! When local files were allowed externally, Aeva was being too ungreedy,
  didn't stop at double quotes and could break page layout when posting a link
@ Why did no one care to tell me that Archive released a new album months ago?!

Version 7.0.700                                  1st October 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
+ Added an admin setting to force HD by default on YouTube videos
  that offer it. Note this will affect all users.
- Removed all other YouTube-related features, thanks to their lack of
  commitment to fixing their broken system. If your Subs-Aeva-Custom file
  made changes to YouTube sizes, make sure to delete them for best results!
+ Added an admin setting to allow anyone to post "local" files that are
  hosted on other servers. Use with caution!
+ Added an admin setting to allow a maximum width for all videos. The new
  ui-height sitelist setting allows you to perfectly resize all videos
+ Added Small/Large links below all videos to allow users to view them at
  the intended embed size, or use the maximum allowed size (if higher).
* Replaced ereg calls with preg_match, for compatibility with PHP6
* Rewrote the External Embedding Disabled error message so that even
  village idiots can understand it. :D

+ Added ui-height for YouTube and DailyMotion... More will come.
! Fixed or updated these sites: YouTube, Vimeo, Archive, Facebook, Ustream, Sapo.

Version 6.9.101                                  29th August 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
@ YouTube removed the ability to choose the internal video format months ago,
  so I'm afraid I had to remove most of that functionality.
- Reduced the number of different quality levels in YouTube to just LQ, HQ and HD.
+ Viewing a 4/3 video in YouTube will now make it larger if you choose the
  HQ setting. You can customize the size through Subs-Aeva-Custom as usual.
! Fixed support for demoscene.tv

Version 6.9.100                                    29th July 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
! This update is not silent, since you'll need to install it if you
  want to keep YouTube support working at least a bit.
! Half-fixed YouTube support by removing all quality levels and simply
  using a HD flag. Will revert to the usual system if YouTube fixes
  support for the "ap" parameter on their side.
* Copyright footer now uses the smalltext class (long overdue!)
! Fixed typo in Crunchyroll support

Version 6.9.99 (silent)                            18th July 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
+ Integrated Karl's fix for "empty body" errors when posting a
  video link and nothing else
! In-context videos weren't always being embedded if displayed
  right after a closed quote
* I'm still keeping the sitelist up to date...
  I'm not sure why, at this point.

Version 6.9.99                                       5th May 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
@ This is intended to be the final version. Potential subsequent
  updates shall only be made through automatic sitelist updates.
! In some cases, Aeva could break message posting boxes
- Removed Aeva link from all posts, moved it to the footer

Version 6.2.77                                    30th April 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- Removed "unlimited" in max items per post/page descriptions (it's
  been disabled for a while because it's the sensible thing to do.)
! Make sure the error message is shown for every video over the
  embedding limits (instead of just videos inside the message
  where the limit was reached.)

* Enlarged Dailymotion videos to be close to the onsite equivalent
* Added support for titles in sapo

Version 6.2.76                                    20th April 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Changed ";fvt" query string to ";checkaeva", and added ability
  to restrict this feature (immediate sitelist update) to admins
! Switching between Wysiwyg and non-Wysiwyg mode would sometimes
  break links due to the autolinker not being restrictive enough
! Fixed HTML validation for SMF2 RC2 and above (as a result though,
  SMF2 RC1's validation will be broken, but it won't last forever)
* Footer copyright now chosen by default, over per-video copyright
- Alternative sitelist download URLs should no longer be needed
! Fixed a <noembed> bug dating back to version 4.x

+ Added support for Ustream, with titles
! Fixed support for GoEar.com, added support for titles
! Fixed support for Yahoo Video
! Fixed support for Slide.com
! Fixed support for iMDb.com
! Fixed support for SouthParkStudios.com (embed code, titles)
! Fixed minor issues and/or titles for Clipster, CollegeHumor,
  Guba, TheHub, Seeqpod, Streetfire, U-tube and vbox7

Version 6.2.75                                    30th March 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
+ Added "Enable Embedding in Sentences" setting, where videos are
  embedded even when they're in a sentence. Disabled by default.
+ Site list updates are now performed every time a video is shown
  (instead of on admin area visits), but no more than once a day
* Site lists are now saved automatically after being downloaded
- Removed SSI hack and option, as it looks like it's all fixed now
! Fixed some rare malformed URLs when embedding was disabled
! Stopped relying on ob_get_length() to replace headers or not

+ Added support for vbox7.com, for a total of 200 sites supported :)
! Fixed support for TrailerAddict.com, added support for titles

Version 6.1.74                                    27th March 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
! Don't use Javascript engine on posts inside RSS feeds (action=.xml)
! Allow [center/li/td]www.url.com[/] just like the http:// version is
! Fixed warning notice when using "Find titles in all sites" option
! Fixed Aeva headers appearing too early if called before </head> is
  written to the buffer but isn't actually empty (which shouldn't happen)
* Better cleanup job (space/tag trimming) on retrieved video titles

+ Added support for Last.fm titles (Artist, Video, YT and Audio pages)

Version 6.1.72                                    24th March 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
@ Updating version number to 6.1 because all Aeva6 crashes are now
  officially gone (well, no such report in a week anyway.)
! Links posted without specifying the http protocol would go through
  an outdated regex pattern and thus show an empty link after the URL
* Added a quick hack (yeah, I hate those, too) to allow for Apple's
  QT vids to be enlarged by 16 pixels where required (embed code fix)

+ Added tentative support for Apple Trailers

Version 6.0.71                                    18th March 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
! Current YT quality now uses default text color, even on dark
  themes - no need to style it anymore, thanks to style inheritance
+ Added temporary "Disable Aeva in SSI calls" function, to make sure
  all SSI problems were fixed recently...
* Slightly re-ordered Aeva admin settings

Version 6.0.70                                    17th March 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
+ Added $context['aeva_safe_passage'] variable, set it to true
  before calling a SSI function if you're confident it will work.
  Don't forget to global $context if you haven't yet, silly.
! Seems there was an incompatibility between PHP 5.2.x and several
  kinds of output buffer functions. Hopefully this might also fix
  SSI-related problems (will remove related workaround if it does.)
+ Added 'show-flashvars' sitelist variable for Justin.tv
! Keep sitelist updates silent if they're false alarms

! Fixed support for Justin.tv (explicit flashvars), added titles
! Fixed support for BBC News titles that had tags in them
! Fixed support for BBC News links with no embedded content

Version 6.0.69                                    14th March 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
! Tentative fix to the incompatibility between Aeva and "Recent
  Posts" features from portals, such as TinyPortal or PortaMX,
  that rely on SSI functions. Yet another geeky solution, yay.
! Looks like YouTube made some changes to their fmt_map code, so
  Aeva would always receive a false positive for HQ and HQ+ formats.
  Obviously, this is fixed now. Until next time, YouTube?

+ Added support for Yandex.ru
! Fixed support for Last.fm when a question mark was used in the URL

Version 6.0.68                                    12th March 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
! Fixed bug where movie link would fail if using ($digit|something)
  in the pattern, but only when $digit would reference an integer
* Rewrote max embeds per post/page feature to allow unembedded videos
  to have a "limit reached" warning next to them. Optimized it all.
- Removed some pre-PHP5 compatibility code which was no longer needed
+ Added ability to prevent retrieving titles, to save time if Aeva
  is set to check all pages but remote site really won't give any
! Fixed a couple of "limit reached" bugs from the days of yore
! Fixed rare bug where the last videos in a page wouldn't embed
! Fixed rare bug where video titles would be corrupted if video
  can't be embedded externally and its title has a # sign in it

+ Added support for Mogulus
! Fixed support for Deezer Playlists (autoplay wasn't disabled)
! Fixed support for Blip.tv (some videos weren't embeddable anymore)
+ Added support for Blip.tv titles and enlarged video embeds

Version 6.0.67                                    10th March 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
! Fixed lookups not being triggered if a title was already provided
  and it had a # in it (which probably happens more than you'd think)
! Optimized object building routine -- not by much, but don't complain
! Made sure aeva_dq class can actually be overwritten in style.css
! Title search would fail if title was broken over several lines
! Decode HTML entities, such as double quotes, when retrieving titles
* Fallback value for movie patterns is now even more flexible

+ Added support for The Onion (with titles)
* Added a thumbnail logo for EbaumsWorld because it's so sad
! "No external embed" and audio were half-broken in BBC News
! Improved support for Deezer (single tracks), added titles
+ Added support for Deezer Playlists and Deezer Radio (no titles)

Version 6.0.66                                     6th March 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
+ Added option "Try to find titles in all sites", if you're brave enough
  to try and compile a list of sites that support easy title retrieval
* Ensured that sites using the old lookup system can search for a title
+ Added a manual option in per-video anchor settings to center the current
  video -- for instance, anysitelink#center or youtubelink#ws-hd-center
* Tweaked the table-based layout to prevent it from being enlarged by the
  browser without asking (because browsers can be rude sometimes. Yes.)
! The sitelist automatic updater would crash on PHP versions < 5.1
! Forgot to update English language file with aeva_center_desc...
+ Added ability to provide a fallback value for sitelist movie patterns
! Fixed a few potential issues in the code that retrieves titles
* Disabled Javascript code for SSI-based calls -- you never know
* Very minor changes to the BBCode conversion script

+ Added support for ExposureRoom (with both quality levels and titles)
+ Added title support for Scribd

Version 6.0.64                                     3rd March 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
@ Here's your daily Aeva. Okay, don't worry, I'm hoping it's the last one...
! Table-based layout wasn't validating properly, and had problems with IE7
! Made sure to insert the Javascript headers only once, for mod compatibility
! The tag whitelist system broke compatibility with third-party video tags, so
  I replaced the tag blacklist with a tag whitelist. This is used when adding
  autolinks on posting for looking URLs up. If a URL has a tag before it,
  the new system will autolink if the tag is center, td, li or a closing tag.
+ Better safe than sorry: added Karl's script (aeva_convert_old_bbcodes.php)
  to the package. If you had a site-specific tag such as [youtube], it will
  convert all of these links to a proper, normal link. Just upload it to your
  root folder, run it and don't forget to delete it when you're done.
+ Added a subtext for the centering option... You never know, it may help.

! Fixed support for Yahoo Video + Firefox (wouldn't work with swfobject)
! Fixed "no external embed" support for YouTube (was changed somehow)

Version 6.0.62                                     2nd March 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
! Now using table-based embeds instead of divs, which should fix layout
  issues with Opera, HD, video titles, video size and/or quality levels
! The sitelist updater should now work, as I've added a workaround in case
  the simplemachines.org website doesn't return a full sitelist file
! Try harder to find a suitable footer class before writing copyright
  info to the body itself (which would break a curious Quick Reply mod)
! Video titles could sometimes be hidden if aeva_install.php wasn't run

! Fixed support for EbaumsWorld Videos, added support for video thumbnails

Version 6.0.60                                     1st March 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
+ Added optional support of SWFObject to embed videos via JavaScript.
  Among other things, it produces valid xhtml and removes the need to click
  twice on a control to enable it. Requires JavaScript to be enabled, of course.
+ Favorite quality level for YouTube is now saved in a cookie for later re-use
+ Added a sitelist parser in the admin area, which will tell you what changed
  whenever Aeva updates the sitelist automatically (additions, removals, mods)
! Fixed interaction with SMF Media Gallery, where local videos would appear
  twice when they're allowed in Aeva and the [smg] tag is used to show them
! Videos wouldn't be looked up when posted right after a BBC tag. This bug
  was introduced back in Aevac 4.0, hopefully it's completely fixed now.
- Removed double-install protection at install time (SMF would't cooperate)
+ Added ability to disable video titles that show up before starting the video
+ Added ability to show video titles in a clickable link below the actual video
+ Embedded video's <div> now has a class name (maeva), meaning you can style it
! Fixed a warning message that appeared when testing for lookups inside admin area
* Rewrote and shortened readme.txt file, again...

+ Added support for video titles in: YouTube (can also disable inline titles),
  Vimeo (same idea), DailyMotion, Veoh, MetaCafe, Google Video, BBC News,
  Yahoo Video, Multiply and Kewego networks - will add more if requested
+ Added support for Demoscene.tv
+ Added support for Multiply.com (videos only, as audio requires logging in)
+ Fixed support for Yahoo Video, added support for video thumbnails (lookups/embed fix)
! Fixed support for Boomp3.com, but what kind of weird site is that?
! Fixed support for Break.com and merged both entries into one
! Fixed support for Kewego network and changed player, hopefully it'll work better
! Fixed support for Facebook Video (could happen to look up the authentication page)
! Fixed support for TM-Tube.com (added a setting to enable script access for it)
! Fixed support for Streetfire.net (embed code and direct links)
! Fixed support for Project Playlist
! Fixed support for Veoh.com
* Changed Godtube.com to Tangle.com, updated links
- Removed support for Dave.tv (yet another site shut down without warning...)

Version 5.2.56                                  31st January 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
+ Added more video quality options (check out the admin area)
! Fixed custom width/height not being applied to videos
! Fixed issue with QuickTime and RealMedia local embedding
! Fixed lookup-urldecode parameter

+ Added support for Slide.com (yeah, a slideshow!)
+ Added support for BombayTV (too funny to pass on)
+ Added support for BBC News articles with attached media files
! Fixed support for CrunchyRoll.com (needed a complete rewrite...)
! Fixed support for PhotoBucket videos, added support for PBR files

Version 5.2.52                                  27th January 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* The Popular Sites list has grown a bit, to around 25 sites. To be included in it,
  a website must not be "niche" or limited to a single country, it must have an English
  version available, and have a ranking below 1,000 at Alexa (probably not the best ranking
  index, but if you find something better, feel free to share.)
* Added lookup-skip-empty parameter (see Custom-Example file for more details)
* Added fix-html-urldecode (same) (only used for CBS Sports, not sure if I'll keep it)
- Removed lookup-check and lookup-predecode parameters (apparently no longer needed)
* Re-organized help section in Example file (you NEED to read it if you plan to customize!)

+ Added support for ALL Kewego-powered sites, including: Kewego (all countries),
  MyKewego, eBay, Lycos, CityVox, LeFigaro, L'Equipe, Metro, M6, Tom's Guide, LeMatin.ch,
  jeuxvideopc.com, Voila and *hundreds* of other sites! Most of them are in French, though.
+ Added support for most Kaltura-powered sites, including Wikipedia (although I couldn't find
  any example). If the video you want to embed doesn't provide embed code, just paste the
  URL to its parent page, and add "#kaltura" (without quotes) next to the URL. Should work!
  Support is only tentative, because I'm not sure whether it is desired by Kaltura itself.
+ Added support for MyTaratata.com (live songs), actually powered by Kewego but
  it uses different URLs so it's going to be separate from Kewego either way.
- Removed Brightcove.tv (site was discontinued on December 2008)
- Removed CityVox and Jubii, as they are part of the Kewego network...
! BBC News links would try to embed even when there weren't any videos in them
! Fixed support for Archive.org, added support for mp4 files. Wasted hours working on
  fixing the Flash player when it actually worked. Grmpf... What? You don't care?!
! Fixed support for ESPN (now, see, *I* don't care about sports, but I'm doing it. Ha!)
! Fixed support for CBS Sports, added support for embed code fix (hmm, see below...)

Version 5.2.50                                  24th January 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* Site list went from 180kb to 142kb by:
  - renaming all array variables to simpler, more logical names
  - reducing the size of countless fix-html patterns, fixing lots of sites in the process,
    and possibly breaking a couple as well (please send a report if you find any!)
+ Added aeva_link class to links below videos, in case you want to style them
! Removed magic quotes fix and added a more generic fix for extra addslashes
* Changed noexternalembed test to something in line with other lookup tests
* Moved a few sites into the Popular section (maybe it was a bit too empty)
* Changed hq-movie system for YouTube videos, to make it easier
  to switch to different movie types for all sites
* Many, many more small changes...

+ Added support for HD in YouTube
+ Added support for noexternalembed in BBC News (in case your lookup server isn't in the UK)
+ Added support for audio in BBC News, and updated lookups to retain the original URLs
+ Added support for audio in Trilulilu.ro
+ Added support for Scribd.com (online e-books)
+ Added support for Cityvox.fr (French video site)
+ Added support for Wat.tv (another French video site, and we're not done yet!)
+ Added support for Allocine.fr (mainly movie trailers, like Excessif.com)
+ Added support for Culturepub.fr (couldn't get the shows to embed, so I just included
  support for the commercials -- with HD, but autoplay can't be set to false, sucks!)
* MySpaceTv is now just MySpace, and links were changed accordingly
! Fixed mp3tube.com lookups (they changed their URL format)
- Removed both GoFish.com entries (closed without warning)
- Removed AOL Uncut (they who try to clone YT are doomed to die)
* Added show-link to Google Video, which doesn't link to its vids

Version 5.1.47                                  18th January 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
! Changing lookup, HQ and embed fix options didn't immediately refresh the site list
! aeva_install.php no longer worked when run as a stand-alone script
* Started simplifying many fix-html-pattern strings, to save space in
  Subs-Aeva-Sites.php and make them less prone to break over time
! Fixed support for clipfish.de embed code
@ (Everything below was actually fixed in the 5.1.42 re-release)
! Lookups sort of failed in YouTube when the URL had a "&" after the video ID
! Removed Generated file from the package installer file, so it should
  no longer erase your customized site list when upgrading
! Added French UTF8 translation to SMF2 install process
! Slightly rewrote latest site list version test
! Fixed config_vars bug when saving site list
! Fixed admin warnings in SMF 1.1.x versions

Version 5.1.42                                  17th January 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
+ Added automatic sitelist updates, when you visit the Aeva admin area (once a day at most)
+ Added automatic new version checks (you'll still have to download them yourself, though)
+ Added support for per-video non-intrusive settings, including widescreen mode and width/height
+ Added support for arrays of lookup patterns, which enables setting these
  automatically at lookup time: YouTube widescreen mode and Facebook video dimensions
* Moved site list creation help comments from Subs-Aeva-Sites.php to Subs-Aeva-Custom-Example.php,
  where it fits best, and added help on adding custom settings at the end of the file
* Split Aeva admin page into two separate pages (Settings and Site List),
  to allow for more breathing space in both sections
* Added a fake user agent when doing lookups, otherwise Facebook wouldn't work
* Try to enable lookups by default on first installs, if available
! lookup-enabled variable from Subs-Aeva-Sites.php was never used
- Removed YouTube external embedding test, as it is now a regular lookup check
+ Added support for Flickr Video (requires lookups), along with custom width/height
! Fixed a bug where putting a link to the YouTube homepage might break the page contents
! Fixed link descriptions getting erased when a lookup was required
* Cleaned up much more code than usual, fixed minor issues, etc...

Version 5.1.36                                   9th January 2009
-----------------------------------------------------------------
+ Added "Subs-Aeva-Custom.php" feature (you will need to use & rename
  the Subs-Aeva-Custom-Example.php file), which adds support for your own
  custom site definitions -- they won't get deleted when upgrading Aeva
+ Added fatal error when trying to install Aeva with previously uninstalling it
* All YouTube international links should now be recognized in the future,
  even if they don't exist yet (also for AOL and Yahoo)
+ Added support for Last.fm France (and possibly other countries)
+ Added support for YouTube videos posted through Last.fm
  (the old video code was broken for them)
+ Added support for Last.fm Artist pages (playlists)
